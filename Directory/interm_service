Interim Car Service


Interim Car Service is due every 6 months or 6000 miles, whichever comes first.

With a solid 25 point checklist, it is designed to check all the important parts and components of the car, including engine oil and changing oil filters.

It also tops-up the main car fluids like brake oil, power-steering fluid, coolant, windscreen additive, and AdBlue (if needed for diesel cars).

The interim car service also includes general checks like external lights, horn, warning lights of different instruments, windscreen wipers, and washers, etc.

Once the general parts are all checked and serviced, it moves on to the main parts like engine, brakes, tyres, suspension system, etc.

The car service entails a check for leaking oils if any, antifreeze strength check, and timing belt replacement if needed.

Brake pads are a crucial factor for the safety of the car and passengers, which is why the interim service includes checking the brake pads for wear and tear.

The tyres pressure, condition, and depth are checked and adjusted, whereas other key components like steering, exhaust, drive system, and suspension system

are checked.
